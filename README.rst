PILKit is a collection of utilities for working with PIL (the Python Imaging
Library).

One of its main features is a set of **processors** which expose a simple
interface for performing manipulations on PIL images.

**For the complete documentation on the latest stable version of PILKit, see**
`PILKit on RTD`_.

Installation
============

1. Install `PIL`_ or `Pillow`_.
2. Run ``pip install pilkit`` (or clone the source and put the pilkit module on
   your path)

.. note:: If you've never seen Pillow before, it considers itself a
   more-frequently updated "friendly" fork of PIL that's compatible with
   setuptools. As such, it shares the same namespace as PIL does and is a
   drop-in replacement.
